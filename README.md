# Solar_System

## Project Description
This program develops and models a toll system. 

Toll stations have a name, city in which they are located, and a numerical value that represents the total value of toll collected.

Vehicles arriving at the toll have a registration plate. The toll charges different toll values ​​depending on the type of vehicle. If it is a car, the toll value is $100. If it is a motorcycle, $50. If it is a truck, the toll value depends on the number of axles, $50 is charged for each axle.

This calculates the toll value of each arriving vehicle and the total tolls collected. Upon completion, the system prints a list on the screen with the vehicles that arrived at the toll and the accumulated total.
